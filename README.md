# Exercise-Pose-Estimation-and-Correction

Lifting weights is an essential component of any good exercise regime. However, it can also be dangerous if performed incorrectly. This project presents a solution that detects and provides suggestions to improve a userâ€™s form during main compound movements.

## Motivation

Most weightlifting injuries occur due to incorrect form while performing individual exercises. The issue of incorrect form has become increasingly prevalent in the wake of COVID, as more people adopted home workouts without access to professional guidance. Without feedback from a personal trainer and minimal prior experience, it can be challenging to learn proper lifting techniques. Fortunately, the proliferation of machine learning research over the past decade has extended into exercise science, enabling innovative solutions for form correction.

## Project Overview

The approach presented in this project provides a promising initial solution to address the issue of incorrect form during exercises. The solution is divided into three key components:

1. **Classifying the Exercise**: Identify the type of exercise being performed.
2. **Generating the Human Pose Model**: Use pose estimation techniques to create a human pose model from the input image or video.
3. **Providing Feedback for Form Correction**: Analyze the pose model and offer actionable feedback to help the user improve their form.

By treating each of these three components as discrete stages, with each stage outputting data for the next, the solution was iteratively refined and calibrated to improve overall performance.

## Learning Experience

This project represents my second-year endeavor and serves as a significant learning curve in both Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Each stage of the project offered unique challenges and opportunities for growth, helping me build a foundation for more advanced applications in the future.
